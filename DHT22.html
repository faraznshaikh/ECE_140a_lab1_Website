      <p>■ Integrating the humidifier to the pi proved to be less of an issue
        than adding the other components</p>
      <p>■ To begin with, we had to connect the humidifier to the pi directly,
      and we also had to use Adafruit's library in order to correctly read the
    humidity and temperature from the device </p>
      <p>■ After grounding and powering the DHT22, downloading the libraries,
        and running a 10k resistor between the VCC and DATA pins on the device,
        we were ready to begin testing!

      <p>■ We first used the Adafruit example library to test the humidifier,
      and it was an immediate success! The temperature and humidity readings
    matched with our expectations, and the output was just fine.</p>
      <p>■ Following this, the next step was to integrate the sound sensor
      to the breadboard and to test all of our devices at once.

      <p>Compared to the other sections of this lab, the humidifier was a nice
      change of pace. Everything seemed very straightforward, and all mistakes
      made were fixed right away. Overall, it was surprisingly simple to add
    such a complicated component to the circuit. </p>
      <p>In the grand scheme of things, the DHT22 doesn't seem like an important
        part of this device, but it gives a good perspective on the variance
        between different parts and their difficulties. Each part of this lab
        has come with its own unique challenges and subtleties, but the DHT22
        was evidence of the fact that you never know what to expect from projects.
