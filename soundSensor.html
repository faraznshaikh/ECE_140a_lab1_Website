			<p>   > Using a breadboard, connect the MCP3008 as a substitute for the analog 
				inputs (audio, envelop) to the board. </p>
			<p>   > After you connect the sound sensor, read the different values using an 
				Oscilloscope. As shown on graph above: Gate(Yellow), Envelope(Green), Audio(Blue). </p>
			<p>   > RESULTS: </p>
			<p>  - Range of values:</p>
			<p>	  	 Gate: High (1) when sound was detected (spoke into the sensor) or Low (0) when quiet. 
				However, because the environment in our lab was loud, the oscilloscope graph output was noisy.</p> 
			<p>	  	 Envelope: As we spoke louder, the envelope increased in amplitude and stabilized as it got quiet. </p>
			<p>  Expectations: The sensor's output voltage was too high (5v) and the results were not exactly what we expected.</p>
				<p>  The logic gate was not changing, audio was very noisy, and the envelope would not stabilize properly. </p>

			<p>   > In order to connect the sound sensor directly to the Raspberry Pi, you must step down the outputs (envelope and audio).</p>
			<p>   > Do this by integrating voltage divider (using 1k and 2k resistors) with a 5V input from the sensor to output 3.3v  </p>
			<p>   > This new output (3.3v) will fix the logic level of the sound detetor and enable it to connect to eh MCP.</p>
			<p>    For visual reference look at schematic above. </p>
