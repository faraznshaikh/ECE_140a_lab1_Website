			<p>■ To begin work with the photocell, we had to first setup the MCP3008 (as pictured)</p>
			<p>■ We followed the instructions provided, and had the MCP setup in no time</p>

			<p>■ With the MCP connected, we then setup the photocell's circuit.</p>
			<p>■ Once connected, we ran some tests, and found that the values we were outputting were acceptable, the pi told us we were reading anywhere from 254 to 1023 on output </p>
			<p>■ We measured the actual resistance with an ohmmeter to find R3 reading 9.9kOhms (as it should), and the photocell reading 1.7kOhms in ambient light and 100kOhms in darkness.</p>
		 	<p>■ With our input values and resistor values, we were able to find Vout varying from 1.67v to 2.78v approximately.</p>
		 <p>■ With the voltage range, the MCP will likely output from 1.67v to 2.78v.</p>

	    <h3> Step 3 </h3>
	    <!-- Not sure what image to place here, I don't think we have more of the photocell circuit  -->
	    	<img src="img/temp.png" class="img" >
			<p>■ Once we actually ran simpletest.py, we were able to see that the values outputted were wrong.</p>
			<p>■ After some investigation, we found that this was due to the input voltage of 5v being too high for the MCP. </p>
			<p>■ To fix this, we simply switched the input voltage to 3.3V, which made our new output readings range from 1.09v to 1.83v.
